Sorting Visualizer

Hey there! I am Shankhari, and I created this project because in my learning journey through algorithms, I was fascinated by the different ways 
in which sorting algos work, and wanted to develop a way for myself (and others!) to better visualize it. I hope you have fun and insights on 
playing around with this project!
